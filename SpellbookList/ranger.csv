1;Disguise Self;1st level Illusion;1 action;Self;"V, S";1 hour;"You make yourself, including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person, look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.<br> The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.<br> To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. ";Ranger (Gloom Stalker)
2;Rope Trick;2nd level Transmutation;1 action;Touch;"V, S, M";1 hour;"(powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.<br> The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.<br> Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.<br> Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. ";Ranger (Gloom Stalker)
3;Fear;3rd level Illusion;1 action;Self (30-foot cone);"V, S, M";"Concentration, up to 1 minute";"(a white feather or the heart of a hen)You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.<br> While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature. ";Ranger (Gloom Stalker)
4;Greater Invisibility;4th level Illusion;1 action;Touch;"V, S";"Concentration, up to 1 minute";You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.;Ranger (Gloom Stalker)
5;Seeming;5th level Illusion;1 action;30 feet;"V, S";8 hours;"This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.<br> The spell disguises physical appearances as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in-between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.<br> The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspections. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner then you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.<br> A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised. ";Ranger (Gloom Stalker)
2;Misty Step;2nd level Conjuration;1 bonus action;Self;V;Instantaneous;"Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.";Ranger (Horizon Walker)
3;Haste;3rd level Transmutation;1 action;30 feet;"V, S, M";"Concentration, up to 1 minute";"(a shaving of licorice root)Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.<br> When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it. ";Ranger (Horizon Walker)
5;Teleportation Circle;5th level Conjuration;1 minute;10 feet;"V, M";1 round;"(rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br> Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence - a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.<br> You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way. ";Ranger (Horizon Walker)
1;Protection from Evil and Good;1st level Abjuration;1 action;Touch;"V, S, M";"Concentration, up to 10 minutes";"(holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures - aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.<br> The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect. ";Ranger (Horizon Walker)(Monster Slayer)
4;Banishment;4th level Abjuration;1 action;60 feet;"V, S, M";"Concentration, up to 1 minute";"(an item distasteful to the target)You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another place of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.<br> If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br> If the target is native to a different plane of existence that the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

2;Zone of Truth;2nd level Enchantment ;1 action;60 feet;"V, S, M";10 minutes;"You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.<br> An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth. ";Ranger 
3;Magic Circle;3rd level Abjuration;1 minute;10 feet;"V, S, M";1 hour;"(holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.<br> Choose one or more of the following types of creatures - celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways.<br> • The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.<br> • The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.<br> • Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature. When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.<br> <b>At Higher Levels</b>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.
